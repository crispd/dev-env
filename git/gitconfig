# Using pull --rebase is good and fine.
# This config assumes that this is not the default, though.
#   Instead, a conflict of sorts should come up, and the user will have to use 'fixup'.
#   This methodology, and the way fixup & rebasing are configured here, makes conflict
#     handling more explicit, commit histories much easier to follow, and ensures
#     that you'll be able to deal with one conflict at a time.
