# Personal take:
#   *in general*
#     - All 'HOME' xdg dirs are for user-level files; system-level is different
#     - While not well defined in the XDG spec, add an application-specific subfolder
#       to these locations so that it's easier to identify application associations
#       and handle cleaning/removal tasks. (i.e. ~./local/share/neovim/)
#   DATA: For portable program/application files. or an alternative to $HOME/.*
#     folders that often end up cluttering one's $HOME directory.
#     (This is where neovim often ends up installed)
#   CONFIG: For the user's personal application-specific configurations
#   STATE: For capturing information generated during runtimes; logs, histories, etc.
#   CACHE: For fleeting information; a temp directory for things that can safely
#     be removed. (I'm unsure what mechanism would actually 'clean' this cache--or how)
